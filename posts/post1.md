![first post](../static/images/posts/scc.png)

Websites have long become a common part of the life of almost every person. Using the sites, you can order food delivery to your home, learn about a new species of insects discovered by scientists, or watch a popular movie. In addition, a website is a convenient opportunity to promote and popularize your project or business. In the article below we will tell you how much it costs to create a website, what this cost depends on and how it can be done.

## How much does it cost to create a website?

Website development is a complex process that does not have universal solutions, because each project has its own individual requirements. That is why the cost of website development is most often calculated from the developer’s fixed hourly rate multiplied by the time spent creating the product.

Prices for website creation start **from 100 thousand rubles and can exceed 1 million rubles**, depending on the customer’s requirements. The more complex functionality needs to be implemented, the higher the cost of creating a website will be. Note that it is also possible to create a website using a website builder, which will be much cheaper, as well as ordering development from a freelancer. However, these methods have many disadvantages, which we will discuss below.

## How does the type of site affect the cost of development?
​
Conventionally, sites can be divided into two types: **information** and **web services**. Information sites include a business card site, landing page, etc. Their main purpose is to transmit information. As a rule, such sites do not have complex functionality.

Web services are sites that allow the user to perform any action. These include web applications, for example, for delivering food or sending email. Their main specialty is user experience. One type of web service is SaaS, which you can learn more about in our article “What is SaaS and why does your project need it?”

The difference in the purpose of these sites will significantly affect the cost. So, an information website will cost at least 100 thousand rubles. But the cost of web services starts from 300 thousand rubles. This difference in price is due to the development of more complex user interaction mechanics for web services.
